<p>Hddsupertool is an advanced disk tool for Linux. It is used to run a script to
send SCSI and ATA commands directly to a disk. It performs a pre-check on the
script before running it. The pre-check is a basic syntax and sanity check. If
the script fails the pre-check, the program will exit without executing the
script. To stop the program at any time hit ctrl-c.

<h2 class="chapter">2 WARNING</h2>
<a name="index-WARNING"></a>

<p>DIRECT IO WARNING!
</p>
<p>This program has two modes, passthrough and direct IO (either IDE or AHCI).
Passthrough expects the drive is recognized by the Linux OS. When using
passthrough you are using the Linux driver, so the driver will be aware of the
activity and there should be no conflicts. However, if you choose to use direct
IO mode, you are bypassing all Linux OS drivers! This could lead to conflicts,
and undesired results if the drive was visible to the OS. HDDSuperTool will not
let you select a drive from the menu that is visible to the OS. You must follow
the method described in the section on how to hide a drive from the OS.
</p>
<p>In IDE mode it is also possible to work with a drive on the same controller as
another (possibly a CD/DVD drive you are booting from). This is an extremely
bad idea! There is a safety warning if this condition is detected. Look at the
port information in the drive list to see if the drive may be sharing the same
controller. At this time CD/DVD drives are not listed by model and serial, but
will show up as patapi device. So if you see another device that has the same
port info except the last number (device select, either 0 or 1 ), then there is
another device on the same controller.
</p>
<p>Also with IDE, if the device is a slave (device select is 1), there may be
unexpected results with return status in the event of an error, or other
unknown issues (safety warning in place for this also). It is highly
recommended that the device be a master on the controller.
</p>
<p>The warnings will make you type the word DANGEROUS to continue for each
condition. If you do choose to continue, you are on your own for any bad things
that may happen! If you have to type it more than once for multiple conditions,
you are really pushing your luck!
</p>
<p>It should be noted that if you manually select the device by setting all of the
port information on the command line, none of the safety checks are performed,
and you are on your own.
</p>
<p>If you do not fully understand these potential issues, then you should not use
direct IO!
</p>
<p>YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

Next: <a href="#USB-Drives" accesskey="n" rel="next">USB Drives</a>, Previous: <a href="#WARNING" accesskey="p" rel="prev">WARNING</a>, Up: <a href="#Top" accesskey="u" rel="up">Top</a> &nbsp; [<a href="#Index" title="Index" rel="index">Index</a>]</p>

<h2 class="chapter">3 How to Hide a Drive from the OS</h2>
<a name="index-How-to-Hide-a-Drive-from-the-OS"></a>

<p>When using direct IDE mode (&ndash;direct) or direct AHCI mode (&ndash;ahci), the drive
must be hidden from the OS for proper operation. The method below requires the
Linux kernel to be 3.13 or newer. Ubuntu 14.04 has kernel 3.13, so it or any
newer version of Ubuntu should work. If you are using a Linux distribution
other than an Ubuntu flavor, you are responsible for knowing the kernel
version.
</p>
<p>Note that when using direct IDE mode with either actual IDE drives or SATA
drives with the bios set for IDE, if you boot the OS without the drive plugged
in / powered up, then Linux will not see it. This is an alternative method that
seems to work the same, but it is still recommended to hide the drive.
</p>
<p>The first thing you need to know is that this is based on the physical port
that the drive is connected to. So once you disable that port you can plug any
drive into it and Linux will not see it (this might not be entirely true for
AHCI, as it would appear that Linux can tell when a device is plugged in and
sends at least one command to it, likely an identify device command, but after
that it leaves it alone). This is true for both IDE and AHCI. However, when
working with SATA drives, switching between IDE and AHCI modes in the BIOS will
change the port numbers and you would need to adjust accordingly. I have also
once experienced the port numbers being different on one boot up, but it looked
like something did not load properly on that boot, and a reboot put things back
to normal.
</p>
<p>The second thing you need is the number related to that port. To get this you
need to plug in a good drive to that port and run HDDSuperTool with the proper
option to list the drives. Below is a sample output from hddsupertool &ndash;ahci:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">1) ata5.00 sda e02a5000 0 e02a5100 ST3120213AS 5LS3NJ70
2) ata6.00 sdb e02a5000 1 e02a5180 Hitachi HDS723020BLA642 MN3220F30JKX9E
3) ata7    --- e02a5000 2 e02a5200 no device
4) ata8    --- e02a5000 3 e02a5280 no device
5) ata9.00 sdg e02a5000 4 e02a5300 WDC WD2500BEAS-00URT0 WD-WXHY07017481
6) ata10    --- e02a5000 5 e02a5380 no device
</pre></div>

<p>Selection number 5 is the drive/port we wish to hide. You can see that the OS
sees it as /dev/sdg. What we want is the number after the ata, which is 9.00.
You must use that number to add a kernel boot option to grub, which in this
case would be:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">libata.force=9.00:disable
</pre></div>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Don&rsquo;t disable the primary hard drive you are booting from! If
you did that to your Linux installation you could very well nuke your OS and
have to repair it.
</p>
<p>To add a boot parameter in an Ubuntu live CD:
</p>
<p>To get to the grub menu on an Ubuntu live CD you need to press any key as soon
as the first small logo appears at the bottom of the screen during boot up. If
the language selection comes up select your language and hit enter. Then hit F6
for Other Options, and when the options box pops up hit ESC. Now you should see
a line on the bottom of the screen, just above the F-key options. Use the right
arrow key to get a cursor flashing and make sure you are at the end of that
line. Also make sure that Try Ubuntu without installing is highlighted above
(up and down arrow keys to change). Add the boot parameter (such as
libata.force=9.00:disable) to the end of the line, and hit enter. Wait for it
to boot up.
</p>
<p>To temporarily add a boot parameter to a kernel of a Linux installation:
</p>
<p>1) Start your system and wait for the GRUB menu to show (if you don&rsquo;t see a
GRUB menu, press and hold the left Shift key right after starting the system).
</p>
<p>2) Now highlight the kernel you want to use, and press the e key. You should be
able to see and edit the commands associated with the highlighted kernel.
</p>
<p>3) Go down to the line starting with linux and add your parameter
libata.force=9.00:disable to its end.
</p>
<p>4) Now press Ctrl + x to boot.
</p>
<p>To make this change permanent:
</p>
<p>1) From a terminal run: sudo gedit /etc/default/grub and enter your password.
</p>
<p>2) Find the line starting with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT and append
libata.force=9.00:disable to its end. For example:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=&quot;quiet splash libata.force=9.00:disable&quot;
</p>
<p>3) Save the file and close the editor.
</p>
<p>4) Finally, start a terminal and run: sudo update-grub to update GRUB&rsquo;s
configuration file (you probably need to enter your password).
</p>
<p>On the next reboot, the kernel should be started with the boot parameter. To
permanently remove it, simply remove the parameter from
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT and run sudo update-grub again.
</p>
<p>After disabling the drive/port you should get a result like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">1) ata5.00 sda e02a5000 0 e02a5100 ST3120213AS 5LS3NJ70
2) ata6.00 sdb e02a5000 1 e02a5180 Hitachi HDS723020BLA642 MN3220F30JKX9E
3) ata7    --- e02a5000 2 e02a5200 no device
4) ata8    --- e02a5000 3 e02a5280 no device
5) ata9    --- e02a5000 4 e02a5300 WDC WD2500BEAS-00URT0 WD-WXHY07017481
6) ata10    --- e02a5000 5 e02a5380 no device
</pre></div>

<p>Notice that there is no longer a decimal place after ata9, and there are dashes
in place of sdg, but the drive is seen by HDDSuperTool as it is listed with
model and serial. This drive/port is now hidden from the OS, and you may use
HDDSuperTool to access it.

<p>When in normal passthrough mode, it may be possible to send ATA commands to USB
attached ATA drives. However, what commands are supported and how the drive
reacts to certain commands is entirely up to the USB adapter interface that is
attached to (or built into) the drive. This means that some commands may not be
supported by the drive, and some commands may give odd results. This is not the
fault of HDDSuperTool. For instance, there are some scripts for Western Digital
that use vendor specific commands to read modules. These scripts will not work
on all USB drives! There is nothing I can do about that. If other commands seem
to work fine, but the vendor specific commands do not then the USB adapter
interface likely does not support those commands.
</p>

<p>This is an advanced utility, and it is very possible to send destructive
commands to a drive. Please make sure you know what you are doing before using
this software. I am in no way responsible for any data loss or damage caused by
using this software. Use it at your own risk!
</p>
<p>While I do my best to ensure that this software does what it is supposed to
without flaw, there is always the possibility of a programming error on my
part. If an error is found, I will fix it as soon as possible. However, I
assume no responsibility for any data loss or damage caused by any programming
error. You are responsible for testing any commands and scripts before using
them on critical data.
</p>
<p>Note that when using passthrough mode that there is normally a buffer limit of
524288. There is a limit stored at /sys/block/DEVICE/queue/max_sectors_kb,
where &quot;DEVICE&quot; is the device you are reading (example
&quot;/sys/block/sda/queue/max_sectors_kb&quot;). The number stored here is referenced in
KB, and the default for a hard drive is usually 512 (meaning 512KB). This
number is smaller for a USB connected drive. If you attempt a command with a
buffer size greater than this you will get an I/O error. This limitation can be
overcome by using the generic scsi name for the device (example: /dev/sg1).
This mapping can be found using the command &quot;lsscsi -g&quot;.

<a name="Installing-1"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">6 Installing</h2>
<a name="index-Installing"></a>

<p>Hddsupertool is supplied as an executable, with separate ones for 32bit and
64bit. You cannot run the 32bit on a 64 bit system and vice versa (you may get
an odd file not found error if you try).
</p>
<p>Hddsupertool now has DEB (Debian/Ubuntu) and RPM (RedHat/Fedora) installers
available. If you have downloaded the appropriate installer then you should
just be able to double click on it to start the installation process. This
method should even work on many live CDs, but not all. If you are unable to use
one of the installers, then you will need to follow the instructions below to
install from the tar.gz file or to run without installing.
</p>
<p>If you have downloaded the tar.gz file, then the easiest way to get started is
to copy the tar.gz file to a flash drive, and then use simple copy and paste to
put it in the Home folder that can be found on the desktop of the Linux
install. When you open a terminal it should default to the same Home folder
that is on the desktop.
</p>
<p>To extract hddsupertool, open a terminal and use the following commands
(replacing the -x.x-x.x.-xxx with proper version number and architecture):
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">gunzip hddsupertool-x.x-x.x.-xxx-free.tar.gz
tar xf hddsupertool-x.x-x.x.-xxx-free.tar
</pre></div>

<p>Then navigate to the proper directory:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">cd hddsupertool-x.x-x.x.-xxx-free
</pre></div>

<p>The following method to install HDDSuperTool will not only work on a Linux
installation, but you can use the same method when booting from a live CD. The
only difference is that every time you use a live CD, you will need to perform
these steps after each boot.
</p>
<p>To install hddsupertool, use the following command:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">sudo make install
</pre></div>

<p>The &quot;make install&quot; command needs to be run as root, which is why &quot;sudo&quot; is
included in this example. Your sysem may use a different command, or you may
already be root. If it is not ran as root, then you will likely get permission
errors and the install will not be complete. Note that you can also uninstall
it with the command &quot;sudo make uninstall&quot;. There is now also an uninstaller
script that can be ran by typing &quot;sudo hddsupertool-uninstall.sh&quot;.
</p>
<p>You must run hddsupertool as root. For Ubuntu you would use &quot;sudo&quot; in front of
the command:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">sudo hddsupertool
</pre></div>
<p>Please consult the documentation for your version of Linux for information on
how to run as root.
</p>

<p>To run it without installing, you must be in the same directory as
hddsupertool. Note that some versions of Linux will not allow you to run a
program from certain external devices (such as a FAT32 USB drive). Example to
run it from the current directory:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">sudo ./hddsupertool
</pre></div>


<p>You may need to change the permissions on the file so that you have the rights
to run it. The following command should do that:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">sudo chmod a+x hddsupertool
</pre></div>


<p>If you are booted from a live CD that does not allow installing with make
(maybe make does not exist) and you are trying to run it from a USB drive and
are getting a permission error, you can copy the executable to the home folder
and run it from there. Note that if using a live CD the home folder exists in
ram and will be cleared on a reboot. The following example assumes you are in
the folder on the USB drive that contains hddsupertool. The first command
copies it to the home folder, the second command gives permission to execute,
and the third command runs it:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">sudo cp hddsupertool /home
sudo chmod a+x /home/hddsupertool
sudo /home/hddsupertool
</pre></div>


<p>You may notice that examples did not include a drive or script. As long as the
hddscripts folder is either in the current working directory, or has been
copied to /usr/local/bin/hddscripts, hddsupertool will start with a menu driven
system. You can still run hddsupertool with manual options to declare which
drive and script with a command such as the following:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">sudo hddsupertool -t /dev/sdb -f ata_identify_device
</pre></div>

<p>Hddsupertool must be run as root. If no arguments are present on the command
line, it will start the passthrough menu mode.
</p>
<p>If no drive is chosen, then all possible available drives will be listed with
model and serial numbers. In passthrough mode, the drives will have the form of
/dev/sdx, followed by model and serial. If the drive is not ATA (did not
respond to identify device command), then the returned sense code will be shown
instead of model/serial.
</p>
<p>In direct mode, it will show driver and port information. From left to right:
Driver, PCI bus ID, Registers port, Control port, Bus port, Device select,
Model, Serial. If there was not a proper response from the identify device
command, then there will be other information in place of the model and serial.
&quot;Busy or drq&quot; will be followed by the status and error register values, and
usually means there are no drives connected to that controller. &quot;No drq&quot; will
be followed by the status register, lba mid, lba high, and either &quot;no device&quot;
or &quot;patapi device&quot;. Patapi indicates there is a CD/DVD drive attached. At this
time hddsupertool does not list CD/DVD drives by model and serial.
</p>
<p>If you would like to see more information about the ports on your system, try
the command &quot;lspci -v&quot;. Note that for SATA drives, the BIOS must be in IDE mode
for direct IO to work. AHCI mode is not supported for direct IO.
</p>
<p>Note that in direct IO mode, DMA access is not available in the free version.
</p>
<p>The format for running hddsupertool is:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">hddsupertool [<var>options</var>] <var>optional_variables</var>
</pre></div>

<p>Where:
</p><dl compact="compact">
<dt><var>optional_variables</var></dt>
<dd><p>Optional variables to be passed to the script from the command line. Both
number and string variables can be passed, with a total limit of 16 variables
that can be passed. A number variable is passed using a single equal sign, and
a string variable is passed using a double equal sign. There must be NO SPACES
BETWEEN THE VARIABLE NAME, EQUALS SIGN, AND VALUE. In the command line you
also DO NOT START THE VARIABLE NAME WITH &quot;$&quot; as you would inside the script.
Number variables will be treated as decimal unless preceeded by 0x in which
case they will be treated as hex. String variables that contain text with
spaces must be enclosed in quotes. The following example will set a number
variable &quot;number&quot; to a value of 255 and a string variable &quot;string&quot; to a line of

<p>Hddsupertool supports the following options:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>-h</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>--help</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Print an informative help message describing the options and exit.

<dt>&lsquo;<samp>-v</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>--version</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Print the version number and exit.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>-V</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>--verbose</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Show additional information. It is multi-level, meaning -V is level 1, -VV is
level 2 and so on.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>-c</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>--check</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Perform the normal pre-check on the script, but do not execute it.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>-C</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>--command</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Use a command prompt to enter commands instead of reading from a script. Note
that some commands will not work on the command line, and will report a generic
error with the command (you can&rsquo;t do conditional statements, loops, or
subroutines). When ran with this option you will get a command prompt of &quot;&gt;&quot;.
To exit the command line mode type &quot;end&quot;. The following example performs a
simple identify device command and displays the raw results.

<h2 class="chapter">8 Tips and Tricks</h2>
<a name="index-Tips-and-Tricks"></a>

<p>Here are a few tips and tricks to help you along.
</p>
<p>HDDSuperTool needs to be run as root. By doing so any files or folders that it
creates will be owned by root. This can make it difficult to edit or delete
files as a user (you will get permission errors). The terminal command &quot;chmod&quot;
will help you with this. It is recommended that you read up on this command and
learn how to use it.
</p>

<p>There may be times when it would be nice to log all screen output to a file.
Someone just recently pointed me to the &quot;script&quot; function. If you type &quot;script
&ndash;help&quot; on the command line it will show the possible options. By default it
will save the log to the file &quot;typescript&quot;.
</p>
<p>The following example would probably be the best way to use the function. This
will log all screen output for that run of hddsupertool to the file named
hddsupertool.log, and stop logging when hddsupertool exits. If the file exists
it will be overwritten.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">script -c &quot;sudo hddsupertool&quot; hddsupertool.log
</pre></div>


<p>HDDSuperTool can be run from a live CD. When running from a live CD it runs in
ram, and all data is lost when you reboot! You are responsible for making sure
that you copy any data you wish to keep to an external drive when running from
a live CD.

<p>The scripting can be a bit overwhelming to even those that are used to some
sort of programming. This section is an attempt to demonstrate the basics.
</p>
<p>The following is a commented script to perform a simple identify device command
and display the raw data.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example"># first we must set the buffer size
buffersize 512

# now we must specify that this is a PIO read command
setreadpio

# now we send the command
ata28cmd 0 0 0 0 0 0xa0 0xec

# show the data on the screen
printbuffer 0 512

# write the data to the file &quot;indentify.bin&quot;
writebuffer &quot;indentify.bin&quot; 0 0 512

# the data returned from this command is in words in litte endian format,
# and can be flipped for easier viewing of the information
# note that this is optional and not normally used for other commands
wordflipbuffer 0 512

# show the flipped data on the screen
printbuffer 0 512
</pre></div>

<p>MHDD has several scripts available for different things. Here is an example of
translating a MHDD script to HDDSuperTool. First here is a MHDD script to dump
2 sectors of module 02 from a WD Marvel drive (popular as the drive passwords
are usually stored there).
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">;script name: read md
;reads md 02 on WD marwell drives
;
reset
waitnbsy

regs = $45 $0b $00 $44 $57 $a0 $80
waitnbsy

regs = $d6 $01 $be $4f $c2 $a0 $b0
waitnbsy
checkdrq
sectorsfrom = cs.bin

regs = $d5 $01 $bf $4f $c2 $a0 $b0
waitnbsy
checkdrq
sectorsto = 21.bin

regs = $d5 $01 $bf $4f $c2 $a0 $b0
waitnbsy
checkdrq
sectorsto = 22.bin

; end
</pre></div>
<p>This also requires the 512 byte file cs.bin to have been created by the user
with the following data. Note that only the first line has data, the rest of
the file is 0 filled.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">0x000  08 00 01 00 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

<h2 class="chapter">12 Script Commands</h2>
<a name="index-Script-Commands"></a>

<p>Note that all commands, operators, operands, and variables in the script MUST
BE SEPARATED BY A SPACE. For example, &quot;SETI $a=1&quot; is not correct and will be
rejected. The proper command would be &quot;SETI $a = 1&quot;. This is the syntax that I
used as it allows for less complicated programming code. Items can be
separated by more than one space with no issues, it just has to be a minimum of
one space.
</p>
<p>Note that all numbers written in the script are assumed to be in decimal
format, unless specified as hex by a proceeding &quot;0x&quot;. The exeption is when
setting the buffer all numbers are assumed in hex format.
</p>
<p>All commands are available in all small letters or all capital letters, but
they cannot be mixed small and capital letters. Commands are in all caps in
this documentation for viewing purposes.
</p>
<p>Most if not all commands will accept variables in place of actual numbers or
text. If you find a command that does not properly accept variables when you
think is should, please report it.
</p>
<p>The available commands and syntax are as follows:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>#</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Comment line. Anything following the # will not be processed. It must be the
first non-space character in the line. You cannot add a comment to the end of
a line.
</p>

</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>ECHO</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Print to screen output. Text can be output using quotes, either single or
double. Quotes of the opposite type inside the original quotes will be output
to the screen. Both string and number variables can also be output. There must
be a space between quotes and variables, and variables must be outside the
quotes. The following is a proper example:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">ECHO &quot;This will print the variable a=&quot; $a &quot; and then the variable b=&quot; $b
ECHO &quot;This will print single 'quotes' within the line&quot;
</pre></div>


</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>SETI</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Set a number variable. All variables must start with &quot;$&quot;. All number variables
are integers of type long long. That means they can be a value from
-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. You can also set it
to another variable, and also do simple math with two operands and one
operator.
</p>
<p>Available operands are:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">+  addition
-  subtraction
*  multiplication
/  division (no remainder)
%  division (result is the remainder)
&amp;  bitwise and
|  bitwise or
^  bitwise exclusive or
&lt;  bitwise shift left
&gt;  bitwise shift right
</pre></div>

<p>Usage examples:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">SETI $a = 3
SETI $b = $a + 0x10
SETI $c = $a * $b
SETI $count = $count + 1
</pre></div>

<p>There are a couple special cases for the SETI command. The first is the
ability to extract a number from a string variable. The format is &quot;SETI $number
= $string location&quot;, where $string is the string variable containing the
number to be extracted, and location is the placement of the number inside the
string, starting with 0 as the first location. The location is based on spaces
or tabs between the numbers. The location can be a number variable itself. If
the number to be extracted starts with 0x it will be processed as hex,
otherwise it will be processed as decimal unless forced using the &quot;HEX&quot;
command. The following example will extract the number 3 from the string 1 2 3
4 5.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">sets $string = &quot;1 2 3 4 5&quot;
SETI $number = $string 2
</pre></div>

<p>The second special case is extracting a number from the buffer or scratchpad
(or sensebuffer, but words are not supported for sensebuffer). You can only
extract a byte, word, double word, or quad word. The format is &quot;SETI $number =
BUFFER location type&quot;, where location is the starting byte location in the
buffer, and type is either b, w, dw, qw. If no type is specified it will assume
the type is byte. Note that the words are little endian, so a buffer value of
11 22 33 44 would be double word value 0x44332211. This can be useful for
extracting information from the identify device results.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">#extract byte 234 from the buffer
SETI $number = BUFFER 234

#extract double word from the buffer starting at byte 234
SETI $number = BUFFER 234 dw
</pre></div>


</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>SETS</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Set a string variable. All variables must start with &quot;$&quot;. The format is the
similar to the ECHO command, except instead of screen output the string ends up
in the variable.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">SETS $string = &quot;This will put the variable a=&quot; $a &quot; and then the variable b=&quot;
$b &quot; along with this message into a string variable&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>There is one exception, where a part of the buffer can be extracted into the
string variable. The format for that is &quot;SETS $string = BUFFER location
length&quot;, where location is the byte position in the buffer and length is the
number of bytes to copy. The following example will put 40 characters from the
buffer starting at byte 54 into a string variable:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">SETS $string = BUFFER 54 40
</pre></div>


</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>EXIT</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>The script will terminate with an exit code. The format is &quot;EXIT number&quot;, where
number is a value from 0-255. Note that the program already uses some of the
lower numbers for program error codes, so it is advised you use numbers 16-255.
</p>

</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>END</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>The script will terminate with a normal exit code of 0.
</p>

</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>HEX</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This forces many commands to default to processing numbers as hex instead of
decimal. It will affect the output of the ECHO command and also the SETS
command. Be very careful using the HEX command, as it can cause undesired
results if left turned on. It is recommended to only use it before a command
such as ECHO to get the desired results from the command, and then use the
DECIMAL command to turn it back off.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">SETI $number = 0x7f
ECHO &quot;The number in decimal is &quot; $number
HEX
ECHO &quot;The number in hex is 0x&quot; $number
DECIMAL
</pre></div>


</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>DECIMAL</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This turns off the HEX command and puts the default number processing back to
decimal. It does not force numbers to be processed as decimal, if they are
proceeded by 0x they are still processed as hex.
</p>

</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>SETBUFFER</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Manually set the buffer contents. The buffer contains the data that is either
sent to or received from the drive. The format is &quot;SETBUFFER offset&quot;, where
offset is a number (can be a variable) that is the location in the buffer to
start. The lines following the SETBUFFER command are the actual data, to be
ended by the ENDBUFFER command. The data must be in the format of
byte-space-byte-space-byte, and the data is always processed as hex. There is
no set number of bytes per row, the next row will just pick up where the last
row left off. A row can start with an additional offset (which will be an
additional offset to the supplied buffer offset). To use the additional offset
start the line with a hex number followed by a colon.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example"># start setting the buffer at offset 128(0x80)
SETBUFFER 0x80
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
  8 9 a b c d e f
  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1a 1b 1c 1d 1e 1f
  # the next line will jump to buffer offset 256(0x100)
  80: 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 2a 2b 2c 2d 2e 2f
ENDBUFFER
</pre></div>


</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>ENDBUFFER</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Required for ending the SETBUFFER command.
</p>

</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>PRINTBUFFER</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Prints the buffer to the screen. The format is &quot;PRINTBUFFER offset size&quot;, where
offset is the starting buffer offset, and size is the number of bytes to be
printed. You cannot print past the end of the current buffer size.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example"># show the first 256 bytes of the buffer
PRINTBUFFER 0 256
</pre></div>


</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>STRINGTOBUFFER</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Puts a string into the buffer contents. The format is &quot;STRINGTOBUFFER offset
size $string&quot;, where offset is the buffer offset, size is the maximum copy
size, and $string is the string variable name. If size is greater than the
length of the string then the whole string will be copied into the buffer, and
the copy will stop at the end of the string. If size is smaller than the length
of the string then it will only copy up to the size limit and the rest of the
string is ignored.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">SETS $string1 = &quot;this is a string&quot;
# copy the whole string (up to 64 bytes) to the buffer starting at offset 0x10
STRINGTOBUFFER 0x10 64 $string1
# copy only the first two words to the beginning of the buffer
STRINGTOBUFFER 0 7 $string1
</pre></div>


</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>CLEARBUFFER</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Clears (erases) the entire buffer contents to zeros.
</p>

</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>BUFFERSIZE</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Sets a new buffer size. This erases (destroys) the current buffer contents. The
format is &quot;BUFFERSIZE size&quot;, where size is the new size of the buffer in bytes.
The default starting buffer size is 512. The maximum buffer size is 33554432
(512 * 65536).
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example"># increase the buffer size to 4096
BUFFERSIZE 4096
</pre></div>


</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>WRITEBUFFER</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Write the buffer or part of the buffer to a file. The format is &quot;WRITEBUFFER
filename bufferoffset fileoffset size&quot;, where filename is the name of the file
to write to, bufferoffset is the byte offset of the starting point in the
buffer, fileoffset is the byte offset of the write point in the file, and size
is the size in bytes to be written. If the file does not exist it will be
created. This will overwrite the designated data in the file, but will not
erase any other data in the file, meaning you can keep adding data to the file
at different offsets.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example"># write the first 512 bytes of the buffer to the file named image.bin
WRITEBUFFER image.bin 0 0 512
# write 512 bytes to the second sector of the file
WRITEBUFFER image.bin 0 512 512
</pre></div>


</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>READBUFFER</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Read a part of a file to the buffer. The format is &quot;READBUFFER filename
bufferoffset fileoffset size&quot;, where filename is the name of the file to read
from, bufferoffset is the byte offset of the starting point in the buffer,
fileoffset is the byte offset of the read point in the file, and size is the
size in bytes to be read.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example"># read the first 512 bytes of the file named image.bin to the start of the
buffer
READBUFFER image.bin 0 0 512
# read the second 512 bytes of the file to the buffer
READBUFFER image.bin 0 512 512
</pre></div>


</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>DIRECTION</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Set the direction of the data transfer to either NONE, TO, FROM, or TOFROM.
This is often required for proper processing of both SCSI and ATA passthrough
commands by the Linux kernel. The proper direction needed for a command can be
found in the SCSI or ATA documentation respectively. Note that for ATA commands
this is set by the SETREADPIO, SETREADDMA, SETWRITEPIO, and SETWRITEDMA
commands respectively, so you do not need to set it directly. You do need to
set it with SCSI commands.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example"># set the direction to read data from the drive
DIRECTION FROM
</pre></div>


</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>SCSI6CMD</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

</pre></div>


</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>PRINTSENSEBUFFER</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Prints the SCSI return sense buffer to the screen so that advanced users can
decode the results. The format is &quot;PRINTSENSEBUFFER offset size&quot;, where offset
is the sense buffer offset, and size is the number of bytes to be printed. The
maximum sense buffer size is 256.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example"># display the contents of the sense buffer that was returned, if any

</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>SETREADPIO</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Prepare for PIO read. Required before performing this type of ATA command. If
the buffer size is set to zero prior to this command, then it will setup for a
non-data command. If you wish to perform a non-data command you should set the
buffer size to zero before performing this command.
</p>

</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>SETWRITEPIO</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Prepare for PIO write. Required before performing this type of ATA command. If
the buffer size is set to zero prior to this command, then it will setup for a
non-data command. If you wish to perform a non-data command you should set the
buffer size to zero before performing this command. The non-data command is the
same as when performing a non-data SETREADPIO command.
</p>

the device bit of the device field will be set for you according to the device
being accessed, in either passthrough or direct IO modes.
b0 = features

<dt>&lsquo;<samp>ATA48CMD</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>ATA 48 bit command. The format is &quot;ATA48CMD  w0 w1 w2 w3 w4 b5 b6&quot;, where w0-w4
are the actual words of the command according to ATA documentation, and b5-b6
are the device and commands bytes. The words are in standard format and not
flipped (not little endian), meaning that 0x0001 has a value of 1. Note that
the device bit of the device field will be set for you according to the device
being accessed, in either passthrough or direct IO modes, so it does not matter
what value you give that bit. Also remember that the LBA order is reversed from
the 28 bit command.

<dt>&lsquo;<samp>WRITELOG</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Write a string variable to a text file as a line. This will append the string
to the end of the existing file. The format is &quot;WRITELOG filename string&quot;,
where filename is the name of the file to be written to, and string is the
variable to be written. If the file does not exist it will be created.

<dt>&lsquo;<samp>GETTIME</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This gets the current time and date and sets two variables. Number variable
$time will have the time in microseconds since the Epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00
+0000 (UTC)). String variable $date will contain the current date and time.

</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>REOPENDISK</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Only for passthrough, has no effect with direct IO. Closes and reopens the
current disk. This seems to perform a soft reset on the drive, which can be
helpful in certain cases where it may not respond properly after performing
certain commands.
</p>

</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>IF</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Conditional if statement. The format is &quot;IF value1 condition value2&quot;, where
value1 and value2 are number or string variables and condition is the
comparison to be made. The values can be actual numbers (or strings) or
variables. If using an actual string (word), do not use quotes, and there
cannot be spaces in the string. To compare strings with spaces in them you must
set and compare string variables. Complex statements are not allowed (more than
one condition). Math is also not allowed within the statement. Multiple IF
statements can be nested. Each IF statement must be ended with the ENDIF
command. Everything in between the IF and ENDIF is executed if the condition is
true.
</p>
<p>Available conditions are:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">&lt;  less than
&gt;  greater than
=  equal
!=  not equal
&lt;=  less than or equal
&gt;=  greater than or equal
Note that only equal and not equal are allowed when comparing strings
</pre></div>

<p>Example:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">seti $high = 100

</pre></div>


</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>ENDIF</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Marks the end of an IF statement.
</p>

</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>ELSE</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Statement to be processed when the IF and any ELSEIF statements are false.
</p>
<p>Example:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">if $a &gt; 0
  echo &quot;a is greater than 0&quot;
else
  echo &quot;a is less than or equal to 0&quot;
endif
</pre></div>


</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>ELSEIF</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Conditional statement to be processed when the IF or preceeding ELSEIF
statements are false. The format is the same as the IF statement.
</p>
<p>Example:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">if $a &gt; 10
  echo &quot;a is greater than 10&quot;
elseif $a &lt; 0
  echo &quot;a is less than 0&quot;

</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>SUBROUTINE</samp>&rsquo;</dt>

the name of the subroutine. The subroutine must be ended with the ENDSUBROUTINE
command.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">subroutine show_ata_return
  echo &quot;ATA return data:

<dt>&lsquo;<samp>ENDSUBROUTINE</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Marks the end of a subroutine.
</p>

</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>GOSUB</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Calls a subroutine. The format is &quot;GOSUB name&quot;, where name is the name of the
subroutine. When the subroutine ends by either the ENDSUBROUTINE or RETURNSUB
command, program execution will resume on the line followin the GOSUB command.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">ata28cmd 0 0 0 0 0 0xa0 0xec

printbuffer 0 512
</pre></div>


</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>RETURNSUB</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Returns from the current subroutine. This is meant to be used with conditional
statements, to be able to exit the subroutine before reaching the ENDSUBROUTINE
command.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">subroutine do_something

  endif
  printbuffer 0 512
endsubroutine
</pre></div>


</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>WHILE</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Conditional loop. The format is the same as the IF command. The WHILE command
must be ended with the DONE command. If the WHILE condition is true then the
code between the WHILE and DONE commands is executed. When the DONE command is
reached, the WHILE condition is checked again to see if it is true or false.
When the condition is false the code continues on after the DONE command,
otherwise it loops back to the beginning of the WHILE command.
</p>
<p>Example:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example"># count from 1 to 10
seti $count = 1
while $count &lt;= 10
  echo &quot;The count is &quot; $count
  seti $count = $count + 1
done
</pre></div>


</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>DONE</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Marks the end of the WHILE command.
</p>

</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>BREAK</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Breaks out of the current WHILE command. This is meant to be used with
conditional statements, to be able to exit the loop without having to get all
the way to the DONE command, or to exit when the condition is still true.
Example:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example"># count from 1 to 10

<dt>&lsquo;<samp>SETSCRATCHPAD</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Manually set the scratchpad contents. The format and use is the same as the
SETBUFFER command. The scratchpad is a second buffer that you can use. The
difference between the buffer and scratchpad is that the scratchpad is not used
for direct disk command data transfers. It is just for storing and manipulating
any data you wish.
</p>
<p>There is one important difference from the SETBUFFER command. The SETSCRATCHPAD
command will allow for values greater than 255. When this happens, it sets a
quad word in the scratchpad, instead of just one byte. This is in place to make
it easier to write variable values to a file. So be careful with this!

<dt>&lsquo;<samp>GETSTATUS</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This will update the status and error registers ($ata_return_error,
$ata_return_status, and $ata_alternate_status). This only works for direct IO.
For passthrough it attempts to send the proper protocol, but it would appear
that Linux does not support that protocol and returns sense data of &quot;invalid
field in CDB&quot;.
</p>

</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>SOFTRESET</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This performs a soft reset of the device. Note that this will reset both
devices on the controller. This only works for direct IO. For passthrough it
attempts to send the proper protocol, but it would appear that Linux does not
support that protocol and returns sense data of &quot;invalid field in CDB&quot;. To
perform a soft reset using passthrough, use the REOPENDISK command.
</p>

</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>USLEEP</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Sleep for x amount of microseconds. The format is &quot;USLEEP microseconds&quot;. This

</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>SOFTTIMEOUT</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Only for direct IO, has no effect with passthrough. When performing an ATA
command, the time to wait before sending a soft reset. The format is
&quot;SOFTTIMEOUT microseconds&quot;. The default is 15000000 (15s). This is used to
automatically perform a soft reset if a command times out, so that it does not
have to be done manually. If this happens, the register status will reflect the
status after the soft reset. The soft reset waits for the drive to be ready up
to the value of RESETTIMEOUT after performing the reset before returning. If
you don&rsquo;t want to perform a soft reset when it times out, set the SOFTTIMEOUT
value greater than the value of GENERALTIMEOUT.
</p>

</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>RESETTIMEOUT</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Only for direct IO, has no effect with passthrough. When performing an ATA
command, the time to wait for the drive to be ready after a soft reset before
returning. The format is &quot;RESETTIMEOUT microseconds&quot;. The default is 15000000
(15s).
</p>

</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>BUSYTIMEOUT</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Only for direct IO, has no effect with passthrough. When performing an ATA
command, the time to wait before giving up if the device is busy prior to
issuing the command. The format is &quot;BUSYTIMEOUT microseconds&quot;. The default is
15000000 (15s). If you don&rsquo;t want the device to time out for being busy, set
this value greater than the value of GENERALTIMEOUT.
</p>

</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>GENERALTIMEOUT</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This timer is mostly for direct IO, but can also influence passthrough in some
circumstances. When performing a command, the time to wait before giving up if
the command has not finished. The format is &quot;GENERALTIMEOUT microseconds&quot;. The
default is 30000000 (30s).
</p>

</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>LOADSCRIPT</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Loads a different script into memory. The format is &quot;LOADSCRIPT script&quot;, where
script is the script file to be loaded. This is mostly designed for a menu
driven system. All current variables will be passed on to the new script. The
new script will start from the beginning.
</p>

</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>PREVIOUSSCRIPT</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Loads the previous script into memory, if there was one. This is designed for a
menu driven system. When returning to the previous script, the previous script
will start from the beginning. All current varaibles will be passed on to the
previous script.
</p>

</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>INCLUDE</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This will append another script file to the end (bottom) the current one in
memory. The format is &quot;INCLUDE script&quot;, where script is the script file to be
loaded. This is useful for including common subroutines without having to copy
them into every script.
</p>

</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>UPLINE</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Used for display purposes. Moves the cursor up one line. This is useful for
repeating data on the screen without scrolling.

Reads are done in blocks (clusters) of 256 sectors.
This means that all warnings and errors show the position

If the required variables below are not set on the command line,
 then you will be propted to enter them.
This requires the number variable startsector to be set.
This requires the number variable endsector to be set.
If endsector is set to 0, it will default to the last addressable sector.
This uses the identify device command to determine the last sector.
This requires the number variable threshold to be set.
Threshold is time in milliseconds.
If a read exceeds the threshold, a warning will be given.
If threshold is set to 0, it will default to 150ms.
This requires the number variable softtimeout to be set.
Softtimeout is the time in milliseconds to wait before giving up on a command.
If softtimeout is set to 0, it will default to 10000ms.
This requires the number variable hardtimeout to be set.
Hardtimeout is the time to wait after a softreset before doing a hardreset.
If hardtimeout is set to 0, it will default to 10000ms.
This requires the string variable logfile to be set.
Logfile will capture all the warnings and errors.
This requires the string variable rateslog to be set.
Rateslog will capture timing info that can be ploted.
Rateslog captures the low, high, and average over 256 block reads.
If logfile and/or ratesfile are blank no log will be produced.

<pre class="example">This command is not supported by all drives.
View the results of the identify device command to check support.
Get the value of the read error control timer.
Optionally set the value of the read error control timer.
This command uses the number variable &quot;timer&quot;.
Timer can be a value from 0-65535.
The timer controls how much time before giving up on a read error.
Normally this is in 100ms increments (value of 5 would be 500ms),
 but this is drive specific (try different values to see what happens).
The default value is 0 (unlimited, all recovery proceedures are tried).
This value is not permenant, it resets with a power cycle.
If timer is not set it will only show the current value.
Example to show current error timer:
  hddsupertool -t /dev/sda -f ata_sct_error_control_timer
Example to set the error control timer to 1:
  hddsupertool -t /dev/sda -f ata_sct_error_control_timer timer=1

Note that even if this command is supported, it may still be of no value.
The ATA documentation states that the data returned may be encoded.
And my experience so far is that the data is usually encoded and totally useless.
So don't get your hopes up about using this command to get any worthwhile data.
It is mainly a demonstration of using the SCT commands.
Example: hddsupertool -t /dev/sdb -f ata48_sct_readlong sector=100 file==&quot;sector100.bin

<p>ata_security_remove_password
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">Remove the password from the disk using 28 bit security disable password command.
This requires either the string variable &quot;password&quot; or &quot;hex&quot; to be set.
Password is the password in plain text.
Hex is the password in hex. It does not require 0x to proceed numbers.
If neither password or hex is set then the password will be blank (all 0s).
DO NOT SET BOTH or you could end up with undesired results!
This requires the number variable &quot;type&quot; to be set on the command line.
Type is either 0 for user password or 1 for master password.
If type is not set it will default to 0.
Example: hddsupertool -t /dev/sdb -f ata_security_remove_password password==&quot;abcd&quot; type=0

Western Digital ROYL patch module 02 to file using vendor specific commands.
Note that some USB drives do not support these vendor specific commands.
This patch is meant for drives that suffer from the &quot;slow&quot; issue.
This patch disables the background scanning on the drive.
This patch is based on data from the following forum thread:
  WD - Fixing the &quot;Slow Issue&quot; manually :
  http://www.hddoracle.com/viewtopic.php?f=86&amp;t=848
This will dump the sectors to the file &quot;&lt;serial&gt;_mod02orig.bin&quot;.
And it will create the file &quot;&lt;serial&gt;_mod02patched.bin&quot;.
It will also create a folder using the model and serial as the folder name,
 and create a backup dump file with the date and time as part of the name.
It will create a backup dump every time a read or write is attempted.
The drive must be power cycled for the changes to take effect.
You have three options:
1) Read the module to a file and create the patch.
2) Write the patched data back to the disk.
3) Restore the original dump.

DO NOT STOP THIS PROCESS OR REMOVE POWER FROM THE DRIVE!!!
IF THE ROM GETS ERASED BUT NOT WRITTEN, DO NOT REMOVE POWER!!!
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!
If you write an incompatible ROM you could kill the drive!
If the erase works but the write fails, you could kill the drive!
In this emergency case, use slow and stupid mode to attempt to write.
Do not use slow and stupid mode unless you erased the rom and are stuck.
It is recommended to perform another ROM dump and check after writing
  to be sure it worked. Use the other scripts for these functions.
If the script fails for any reason, it is recommended to do another dump
  and check to make sure ROM is still in good condition.
