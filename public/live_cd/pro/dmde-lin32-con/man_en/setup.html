</p>
<p>
<span style="color:#ff0000; font-weight: bold;">Attention!</span>
If a device has physical problems 
(input-output errors, slow performance, etc.) 
<strong>it is recommended to address to specialists</strong> - 
see <a href="badrecovery.html">Working with Failing Devices</a>.
If the device is not accessible or has incorrect size see also
<a href="sysrequire.html">System Requirements</a>.
</p>
<p>
<span style="color:#ff0000; font-weight: bold;">Attention!</span>
Do not write anything to the disk containing lost data.
<strong>Recover data to a different disk,
as well load operating system, run the software from a different disk, 
</strong> otherwise the data may be erased irrevocably.
</p>
<p>
It is highly recommended to work in a system which has minimal disk access 
(especially in write mode).
You can create <a href="#dos">a DOS bootable disk</a> 
(to <a href="copysectors.html">clone disks</a> available in IDE mode),
or use bootable LiveCD/USB disks based on <b>Linux</b>
or special environment like WinFE based on <b>Windows</b>, where disk access is minimized.
</p>
<p>
For the most compliance with such environment it is recommended to turn off the "fast boot" option 
and turn on the "USB legacy" mode in your BIOS/UEFI.
To boot from the Live disk you may also need to turn off Secure Boot and UEFI mode (switch to Legacy BIOS mode).
</p>

<p>
<b>To install</b>/reinstall and run the program just extract the entire software package into a single directory
(it may be on a removable media) and run <span class="tt">dmde.exe</span> or <span class="tt">dmde</span>. 
You need Administrator&nbsp;/ Superuser priveleges to access devices in Windows NT+, Linux, macOS.
To run the software without Administrator rights add the parameter 
<span class="tt">notadmin=1</span> to the file <span class="tt">dmde.ini</span>.
Updates are performed in the same way.
</p>
<p>
<b>To uninstall</b> the software just remove the extracted files and directories.
</p>

<h2>Operating Systems</h2>
<h3 id="windows"><span id="win7"></span>Windows Vista/7/higher</h3>
<p>
In case of SmartScreen request click "More Info" and confirm the software launch.<br />
To run the program as Administrator use right-click menu on the application icon
or confirm UAC elevation request.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000; font-weight: bold;">Attention!</span>
To work with drives larger than 2TB 
the most recent versions of controller drivers must be installed.
</p>

<h3 id="winxp">Windows 2K/XP</h3>
<p>
To use the program you should login as Administrator. <br />
<span style="color:#ff0000; font-weight: bold;">Attention!</span>
To work with 128GB and larger drives you need Windows 2K SP4 with LBA48 support manually switched on 
in the registers or Windows XP SP2 (LBA48 is switched on by default).
</p>

<h3 id="win98">Windows 98/ME</h3>
<p>
<span style="color:#ff0000; font-weight: bold;">Attention!</span>
Without special patches Windows 9x/ME handles 128GB and larger drives incorrectly.<br />
To avoid the problem reload computer in MS-DOS mode and use DMDE for DOS  
to access such drives via BIOS or ATA-interface or load another OS.
</p>

<h3 id="linux">Linux</h3>
<p>
At first go to the Root Terminal or run Terminal emulator (Konsole, Gnome-terminal, etc.). 
Go to the software directory and type <span class="tt">./dmde</span>. 
You should run the software as a superuser to access devices. 
Please, refer to your operating system documentation for this information 
(e.g., run <span class="tt">sudo ./dmde</span> in Ubuntu, go to root with <span class="tt">su</span> command in Debian at first, etc.). 
You may also need to set execution permission for the file <span class="tt">dmde</span> (type <span class="tt">chmod 755 ./dmde</span>).
To run 32-bit software versions on 64-bit operating systems 
you may have to install additional 32-bit shared libraries 
(e.g., run <span class="tt">sudo apt-get install libc6-i386</span> in Ubuntu to install <span class="tt">libc6-i386</span> package).
</p>

<h3 id="macos">MacOS</h3>
<p>
Since the modern macOS versions try preventing direct disk access
and are less suitable to work with failing drives it is recommended to use different OS's.
If there is no different PC you can try to create and load Ubuntu LiveUSB by the 
<a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-macos" target="_blank">instruction</a>.
</p>
<p>
In macOS you can try to unmount the disk using the system's Disk Utility to gain access.

If macOS prevents disk access you may need to turn off the partition tables in a different OS
(use commands <span class="ii">MBR Off&nbsp;/ GPT Off</span> in DMDE 
in the <a href="partitions.html">Partitions</a> window).
</p>
<p>
If macOS blocks the application running you can use Control-Click or go to System Preferences, 
choose Security&nbsp;& Privacy and click "Open anyway" for the blocked application:
<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491" target="_blank">Safely open apps on your Mac</a>
</p>
<p>
It is also possible to run the software as a root user from terminal,
refer to the Linux instructions above.
</p>
<p>
MacOS specially marks applications got from the Internet and runs them from a randomized directory.
In such case the software cannot run portable 
and uses the user default application support directory for keeping settings and keys.
To make application portable run the command in the terminal<br /> 
<span class="tt">xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /&lt;path to the app&gt;/dmde.app</span><br /> 
or simply move the directory containing the app and <span class="tt">dmde.ini</span> file
to a media not supporting extended attributes (i.g. to a FAT formatted USB flash drive).
</p>

<h3 id="dos">DOS</h3>
<p>
If there are problems with video ouput 
you may need to change the value of the parameter <span class="tt">biosoutput=0</span>
in the file <span class="tt">dmde.ini</span> into:
<span class="tt">biosoutput=1</span>
</p>
<p>
If an error occurs when starting the software, there may be a problem with an extended memory manager. 
Try using the old memory manager by running the batch file <span class="tt">dmde_dpo.bat</span>
however less memory will be available.
</p>
<p>
You may use DMDE on a regular partition supported by DOS or use DOS bootable disk.
This may be helpful when there are problems using specific disk.
SATA disks must be switched to IDE-compatible mode in BIOS settings for direct ATA-access.
SCSI, USB, and other devices may be accessed via special DOS drivers or 
using BIOS functions if they are supported.
</p>
<p>
Some files for creating DOS boot disks are available on the <a href="about.html">software site</a>
in the section <a class="extern" href="http://dmde.com/moredownload.html" target="_blank">Additional Downloads</a>.
</p>
<h4>Bootable Floppy</h4>
<p>
To create bootable floppy download and unpack <b>FDD image</b>.
You may use the function <a href="copysectors.html">Copy Sectors</a> 
to write the image to a floppy disk. Use the image as a source file and fdd as a destination device.
ISO images for bootable CD may also be created on the base of boot FDD images 
with the help of different software.
</p>
<h4>DOS Bootable Disk</h4>
<p>
Loading from the specific disk must be supported by BIOS (see BIOS boot menu).
To create bootable USB/HDD you need a freshly formatted primary FAT16/FAT32 partition on the disk.
Non-standard disks/partitions are not supported (non-MBR, 3TB+, etc.).
</p>
<p>
<b>0.</b>&nbsp;For the most compatibility optionally first <a href="fillsectors.html">zero out the disk</a>,
then initialize disk as MBR and create and format a primary FAT partition using standard OS means
(Windows Disk management).
<br />
<b>1.</b>&nbsp;Download the 
<a class="extern" href="http://dmde.com/moredownload.html" target="_blank">FreeDOS Package</a>
(the site section "Additional downloads")
and extract all package files directly to the root directory of the FAT partition.
<br />
<b>2.</b>&nbsp;Open the disk as <a href="devices.html">physical device</a> in DMDE
and use the command <span class="ii">Write Boot Sectors...</span> in the 
<a href="partitions.html">Partitions</a> menu to make the device bootable
(specify the root directory on the disk as a source of boot sectors upon the subsequent request).
Apply changes and close DMDE.
<br />
<b>3.</b>&nbsp;<a href="http://dmde.com/download.html" target="_blank">Download DMDE for DOS</a> 
and unpack into the FAT partition.
<br />
<b>4.</b>&nbsp;Use BIOS boot menu&nbsp;/ BIOS setup to boot from the specified disk. 
On modern UEFI systems you may need to enable BIOS legacy mode, turn off secure boot option,
switch USB and other devices to legacy modes.
