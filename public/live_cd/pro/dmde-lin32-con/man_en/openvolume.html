<h2>Find and Open Volume</h2> 
<p>
To browse, view, edit, and <a href="datarecovery.html">recover files and directories</a> 
you should find and open a volume containing data.
Use the following methods depending on the availability.
</p>
<p>
<strong>1.</strong> If the volume is fully available by its letter 
(<span class="tt">C:</span>, <span class="tt">D:</span>, ...),
you may open it through the option <span class="ii">Logical&nbsp;Disks</span> (Volumes&nbsp;/ DOS&nbsp;Services)
in the dialog box <a href="devices.html">Select&nbsp;Drive</a>.
This method is suitable to recover deleted files from a healthy volume.
If you cannot open this way or files are being recovered incorrectly try the next methods.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2.</strong> Select a <span class="ii">Physical&nbsp;Device</span> containing the volume 
in the dialog box <a href="devices.html">Select&nbsp;drive</a>.
The window "<a href="partitions.html">Partitions</a>" will pop up.
Select and open your volume if it is available there.
If it is not available or data cannot be properly recovered 
then try the next method for the most complicated cases.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.</strong> Run <a href="fullscan.html">Full Scan</a> and open one of the found volume variants. 
Read the section <a href="fullscan.html">Full Scan</a> for more efficient recovery in this case.
</p>

<p>
The context menu command <span class="ii">Open volume parameters</span> allows
manually changing some parameters before opening the volume.
</p>
<p>
Also, the volume may be opened from
the <a href="diskeditor.html">Editor Window</a> 
when view the volume boot sector or boot sector copy
in a <a href="menu_viewas.html#boot">Boot sector</a> mode.

<p>
If the data storage is a RAID array&nbsp;/ striped volume 
you should first <a href="raids.html">Construct a RAID</a> instead of opening 
a single physical device.
</p>
<p>
If the volume is contained inside a virtual machine&nbsp;/ encrypted disk image or partition
you should first mount&nbsp;/ decrypt the image (or its copy, for safety) using the corresponding (virtualization) software
and then work with the mounted&nbsp;/ decrypted disk.
However you may also open a flat image and VHD/VHDX image directly 
using the option <span class="ii">Disk Images</span> of the <a href="devices.html">Device Selection</a> box.
