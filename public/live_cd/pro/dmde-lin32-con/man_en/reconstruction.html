<h3>Virtual File System Reconstruction</h3>
<p>
Open virtual directory <span class="ii">[All Found / Virtual FS]</span> in the <a href="filepanel.html">File Panel</a>
to virtually reconstruct directory structure and prepare found and removed files and directories for 
<a href="datarecovery.html">recovery</a>.
You may reopen the directory again to get more or less results in the reconstruction depending on your need.
</p>
<p>
The results of the <a href="fullscan.html">Full Scan</a> are used (if the scan was performed).
If files are recovered incorrectly you should try found different volumes -
return to the results of the <a href="fullscan.html">Full Scan</a> 
or to the window <a href="partitions.html">Partitions</a> and open the next volume.
</p>
<h4>FAT/exFAT</h4>
<div class="l">
<b class="ii">Rescan current file system</b>
<p>
Rescan the entire volume if the results within the current FS format only are needed
and <a href="fullscan.html">Full Scan</a> is not fulfilled.
</p>
<b class="ii">Default reconstruction</b>
<p>Use the results of the <a href="fullscan.html">Full Scan</a>.
</p>
<b>FAT Tables Options ("<span class="ii">Parameters</span>")</b>
<p>
FAT tables contain cluster chains to assemble fragmented files and directories.
By testing tables the software selects which table to use or not to use both.
However you may try different options to achieve better results
of the reconstruction and data recovery in the whole or for specific files.
</p>
<p>
You may choose which table copy to use (<b>FAT1</b> or <b>FAT2</b>) or not to use both. 
The option <b class="ii">check (do not use bad sectors)</b> may allow avoiding some wrong chains
if there is some damage in tables. 
ExFAT has only one FAT table which cannot be properly tested 
(values are correctly defined for fragmented file chains only).
</p>

<h4>Non-FAT File Systems</h4>
<div class="l">
<b class="ii">Pure FS Reconstruction</b>
<p>
The option provides results within the original FS only.
For slightly damaged FS these are enough and the most accurate results.
</p>
<b class="ii">Default Reconstruction, Less (--) or More (++) Results</b>
<p>
Use the results of <a href="fullscan.html">Full Scan</a>.
You may decrease and increase the number of results with buttons <b class="ii">--</b>&nbsp;and <b class="ii">++</b>.
The color indicator schematically shows the quality and the number of the selected results
(the more additional results the worse their quality).
</p>
<div class="spec">
<b class="ii">Advanced</b>
<p>Advanced parameters are primarily for specialists to make some corrections for the reconstruction
if a file system is significantly damaged.
</p>
<b class="ii">MFT Numbers</b> (NTFS)
<p>
Filter files by MFT numbers for a partial reconstruction 
(may be useful if there is not enough RAM for the entire reconstruction).
</p>
<b class="ii">prevent wrong merging</b>
<p>
Prevent possible wrong merging of directory branches by considering time stamps.
</p>
<b class="ii">process INDX'es</b> (NTFS)
<p>
Better (but slower) directory structure reconstruction using information from INDX'es 
on top of omitted MFT info (<b class="ii">max</b> - force INDX processing).
</p>
<b>Shifted</b> (NTFS)
<p>
Include shifted MFT records 
(<a href="fullscan.html">Full Scan</a> must be performed before).
</p>
<b>Extra Found</b> (NTFS)
<p>
Include extra found files into the reconstruction 
(may contain more garbage but may help if some file is not recoverable other ways).
</p>
<b>Tech. Records</b> (NTFS)
<p>
Include special MFT records into the reconstruction for analysis.
</p>
<span class="ii">MFT / FS Fragments</span>
<p>Manually select FS fragments to use in the reconstruction.
Fragments are grouped by the relevance to the opened volume (calculated statistically):<br />
<span class="ii">the best</span>, <span class="ii">correct</span> - most relevant and relevant,<br />
<b class="ii">related</b> - may be relevant to the opened volume variants (cf. <a href="fullscan.html">Full Scan</a>),<br />
<b class="ii">unknown</b> - relevant volume is not detected,<br />
<b class="ii">extraneous</b> - relevant to a different volume,<br />
<b class="ii">small (extra found)</b> - too small for statistics,<br />
<b class="ii">disabled</b> - incompatible due to different FS parameters.
</p>
<h5>ReFS</h5>
<p>
In ReFS v3 any directory node contains a volume id. 
<span class="ii">Other</span> nodes 
in the <span class="ii">FS Fragments</span> list
are nodes with an id which is different from the opened volume id.
</p>
<p>
In a correct FS <span class="ii">top</span> nodes contain links for all 
<span class="ii">rest</span> nodes (intermediate and leaf nodes).
Upon any change ReFS writes new node versions in a new location and update links so 
there may be many <span class="ii">old directory nodes</span> without references.
However for a damaged FS there may be also lost nodes among them.
By default <span class="ii">old directory nodes</span> are processed as well
but a file version control is used to exclude old file refernces 
(unless the option <span class="ii">include all old file entries</span> is turned on).
