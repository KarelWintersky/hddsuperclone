#### v0.4.5 ####
Released 2022-02-25

- Fixed an issue that emerged with the mapfile backup mechanism in ddrescue 1.24 and later.
  When an update interval was set in ddrescueview, the program would be stuck on the backup version
  of the mapfile, causing no progress to be shown over time.
  With this patch, ddrescueview avoids the issue by re-opening the file every time it needs to be read.
- Abandoned the nonsensical versioning scheme (alpha x - labled versions)

#### v0.4 alpha 4 ####
Released 2020-09-01

- Updated to compile on FPC 3.2.0 without errors. Thanks to Peter Green for the patch.
- It's now possible to select a range on the Zoom Bar using right click dragging, just like on the Block Grid.
- Added an option in the Settings to zoom in on mouse position without centering the Block Grid on that position.
  This is now the default. It seems more intuitive when the blocks previously under the mouse 
  stay under the mouse after zooming in or out.
- Added an Option 'Center on Current Position' to the View menu, which keeps the Block Grid centered on the 
  current rescue position. Handy to keep the rescue position on screen when zoomed in. 
  This overrides much of the usual zooming functionality and deactivates interaction with the Zoom Bar.
- Zooming and scrolling in large map files is now considerably faster.
- Application title (as reported to the OS, for the task bar etc.) now shows loaded file name.
- The program will now make a second attempt to refresh the mapfile, when ddrescue is currently rewriting it.
- New application icon in multiple sizes up to 256x256
- Reduced compiler warnings and hints

#### v0.4 alpha 3 ####
Released 2016-07-20

- Renamed 'logfile' to 'mapfile', to reflect the changes in ddrescue 1.20.
- Support for mapfiles from ddrescue 1.22 added. The current pass is displayed in the GUI.
- Improved speed of the mapfile parser for very large files.
- Added a bunch of command-line switches. ddrescueview now supports the following arguments:
    ddrescueview <options> -m domain-mapfile rescue-mapfile
    where rescue-mapfile must come last and <options> can be:
     -r (off|5s|10s|30s|1m|2m|5m)  Set refresh interval, e.g. -r 30s
     -lp                           Show log panel
     -gs (4|6|..|24)               Set grid size, e.g. -gs 10  
     -ub                           Use binary unit prefixes instead of decimal
     -x left                       X position of window on screen, in pixels
     -y top                        Y position of window on screen, in pixels
     -w width                      Client-width of window, in pixels
     -h height                     Client-height of window, in pixels
     -safe                         Turn off optimizations       


#### v0.4 alpha 2 ####
Released 2015-05-27

- The wiki on the sourceforge page now has some documentation for the program.
- Support for domain log files. Outside-domain blocks are painted dark gray by default.
  The commandline parameter for the domain log file is -m domain_logfile.
- Option to show the inside-domain blocks contiguously, useful for highly fragmented domains.
- Up to 10x faster block drawing using direct memory writes. Includes fallback if not supported.
- Right mouse-button dragging on the block grid now zooms in to the dragged area.
- Redesigned the top panel again.
- Changed formatting of most size strings in the top panel and the Block inspector.
- Double-Clicking the labels in the Rescue status box now toggles between sectors, bytes and hex.
- Error count now shows only the number of 'bad sector' areas, to keep up with ddrescue 1.20.
- The zoom bar now scrolls whole block rows, except when touching the start or end of device.
- The zoom bar now has better highlighting of the zoomed-in area.
- A screenshot of the main window can be saved from the File menu.
- The pie chart in the top border is now shown as an empty circle when no file is opened.
- Pressing ESC now closes the active window, except for the main window.
- The status bar now shows [Updating...] or [Opening...] while refreshing or opening a log file.
- Block inspector: Window now uses its previous position on screen when re-opened.
- Block inspector: Checking Track Cur. Position checkbox now changes block to current position.
- Block inspector: Deselects block on the main form when closed.
- Fixed device sector size set to Custom (0) on program start. Now 512.
- Fixed various resizing bugs with the Bottom panel.
- Unused blocks at the end of the grid are not selectable any more.
- The Comment line memo now clears its contents when the log file is closed.
- Fixed excessive menu bar flickering on win32 when dragging the zoom bar.
- Zoom bar now shows full device when device size changes, block grid stays at current zoom setting.
- No more unused blocks when zooming far into the end of the rescue device.
- Fixed slider values in the settings dialog not updating correctly.
- More robust error handling in the parser prevents crash when fed with unparsable logfile.
- The parser now forgets the previously parsed comment lines when re-reading the logfile.
- Fixed some integer overflows for very large drives. Should now work with drives up to 8 EiB.


#### v0.4 alpha ####
Released 2015-04-13

- Added ability to zoom the block grid using the mouse wheel
- Added a 'zoom bar' left of the block grid, which can be used to shift the zoomed-in area.
- Renamed the 'non-split' status to 'non-scraped' to keep up with ddrescue 1.19.
- The rescue status (error size, current phase etc.) is now shown in the top panel.
- The status bar now only shows the log file name.
- Renamed and reordered items in the main window's menu.
- The top panel block info has been removed. Only the block color key is shown.
