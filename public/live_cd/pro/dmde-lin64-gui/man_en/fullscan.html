<h2>Full Scan</h2>
<p>
<a href="#raw">Raw File Search</a> 
&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
Comprehensive search method allows you to find and virtually rebuild the directory structure 
of a damaged file system or to find lost files of known types by signatures if a file system can not be used.
</p>
<p>
If a file system is not seriously damaged then the volume may be opened before the scan completes. 
When choosing a volume, you can be guided by quality indicators and other parameters (details are <a href="#columns">below</a>).
</p>
<p>
Before working with special types of storages 
(striped volumes&nbsp;/ RAIDs, encrypted storages, disk images), 
refer to the <a href="openvolume.html#open_sstor">appropriate instructions</a> 
(in the section <a href="openvolume.html">Open Volume</a>), 
otherwise Full Scan will give incorrect FS results if you simply run on individual source disks.

For regular partition, it is recommended to <a href="devices.html">open a physical device</a> 
and scan the entire area the partition may occupy (including previous and new locations)
rather than trying to work with the damaged logical disk.
The software may read beyond the selected area if it is necessary.
</p>
<p>
<b>Different volume variants may be given for the same volume</b> which are usefull in the most complex cases <b>only</b>
(such as interrupted FS transformation: move&nbsp;/ split&nbsp;/ merge&nbsp;/ resize&nbsp;/ cluster resize, 
or for spanned volumes).

In such cases some files can be recovered correctly from one volume variant,
and others from another one, despite the same files might be visible on both volume variants.

Open the selected variant as a volume and <a href="datarecovery.html">recover</a> files.
If files are missing or being recovered incorrectly you should continue the scan or try another variant.
</p>

<p>
The columns <b class="ii">%</b> and <b class="ii">Check</b> allow 
preliminary estimating data recovery quality of a found volume variant
(the percentage and number of correct interconnections between FS structures and files 
found by <a href="#raw">signatures</a> for <b>NTFS, exFAT, HFS</b>;
and for other file systems only FS structures are checked).
</p>
<p>
<b class="ii">Min. Size</b> is the minimum size estimate of the area occupied by the volume files 
(only the best found FS fragments are taken into account).
</p>

<p>
The column <b class="ii">Indicators</b>
shows the absence (damage) ("<b class="ii">-</b>") 
or presence ("<b class="ii">+</b>") of the corresponding FS structures
(<b class="ii">B/C</b> - boot sector/copy; for <b>FAT</b>: <b class="ii">F</b> - FAT table/copy, <b class="ii">R</b> - root directory).
</p>

<h3 id="raw">Raw File Search</h3>
<p>
File signatures are used as a last resort to find lost files when recovery by file systems (above) is not possible.
Additionally file signatures are used to improve and control the quality for <b>NTFS, exFAT, HFS</b> search.
They are also used to mark and filter files found both by a file system and by signatures,
that is files with a high probability of recovery
(see <a href="filepanel.html#fileicons">File Panel icons</a>).
</p>
<p>
Raw results are available under the directory <span class="ii">$Raw</span> in the <a href="filepanel.html">file panel</a>
when any volume is opened.
To exclude results found by a file system of an opened volume, 
you can use the symbolic directory <span class="ii">$Raw - Filter Raw Results</span>
(<a href="clustermap.html">cluster map</a> features are used to determine and exclude the space 
occupied by files).
</p>
<p>
Normally there are no reasons to open Raw results individually when there are FS results.
Raw recovery is possible only for files which have special signatures.
Raw recovery does not work properly for fragmented files (only the first file fragment is recovered correctly).
Raw recovery does not provide original file names and directory structure.
Raw recovery does not always allow detecting original file sizes.
If there is neither end file signature nor built-in size info for a given file type
then it is assumed a file continues until the next found signature,
so searching for all present file types may improve size detection.
</p>
<p>
For some built-in file types, consecutive fragments can be combined into one file, 
so the number of files in the file panel may be less than in the scan results. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="ii">Raw: File Signatures</span>: select file types for search, add new file signatures.
</p>
<h4>File Signatures</h4>
<p>File Signature is a fixed sequence of bytes at the file beginning for the certain file type. 
E.g. if you open any PDF file in a <a href="diskeditor.html">hex editor</a> 
you can see the same sequence of the first 4&nbsp;bytes:
<div class="spec" style="font-family:monospace">
0000: &nbsp; <span style="color:blue">25 50 44 46</span> 2D 31 2E 33&nbsp; 0A ... &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span style="color:blue">%PDF</span>-1.3...
</div>
In DMDE you may then specify a custom file <span class="ii">signature</span> as <span class="tt">%PDF</span>
(or as <span class="tt">\x25\x50\x44\x46</span> in hex codes).
The question mark (<span class="tt">?</span>) may be used to specify a variable byte of the signature.
The code <span class="tt">\mXY</span> specifes a fixed bit mask for the previous byte 
where <span class="tt">XY</span> is a mask hex value
(e.g. the code <span class="tt">\x02\m03</span> cpecifies that
only two least significant bits of the byte <span class="tt">\x02</span> are fixed).
</p>
<p>
If the signature position in a file is not fixed then minimum and maximum offsets must be specified.
Entire signature must fit in the first 4096 bytes.
</p>
<h4 id="raw_add">Adding New File Types</h4>
<p>
In addition to built-in file types and corresponding signatures, 
it is possible to add new types by the user (only if these types have unique signatures):
Full Scan (Parameters) - <span class="ii">Raw: File Signatures</span>&nbsp;- <span class="ii">Add</span>.
</p>
<p>
In simple cases, it is possible to automatically calculate the signature of a new type 
on the base of sample files.
You should push the button "<span class="ii">...</span>"
and specify possible extenstions (comma separated) and the path where working files of the necessary type are located.
If the recovery is being made from the camera, you can take a different photo&nbsp;/ video 
to the new media in the same format to obtain sample files.
</p>
<p>
The <span class="ii">Test</span> button allows you to check the signatures on a specific file 
and find out whether files of this type are defined correctly.
</p>

<div class="spec">
<p>
The option <span class="ii">use for FS calculation</span>
enables checking interconnections between FS structures and files found by the signature.
Additionally the files in the FS will be marked in a <a href="filepanel.html#fileicons">File Panel</a>
as found also by a signature (or not found).
<br />

Multiple comma separated <span class="ii">Extensions</span> may be specified for <span class="ii">FS calculation</span>.<br />
Mark signature as <span class="ii">reliable</span> if it contains at least 4 different bytes at a fixed position
(do not mark otherwise not to truncate other files if false positives happen).<br />
<span class="ii">File-container</span> may contain other file types inside
(mark in order not to truncate when other type files are met).<br />
<span class="ii">EOF Signature</span> is an optional signature at the end of a file.
